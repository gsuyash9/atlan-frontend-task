## Steps taken to improve page load time
 - I used Angular material for most of the UI, that improved a lot of speed and decreased the bundle size.
 - I also reduces bundle sizes by eleminating unused css and JavaScript.
 - Using formats like .webp helps optimize the images a lot but for now I have used .png images, and as they are single coloured, they are quite smaller than jpeg.
